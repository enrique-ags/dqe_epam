Here are the two challenges you requested, described in English, along with their solutions.

---

### Challenge 1: PySpark Challenge
1. Read a CSV file named `expenses.csv` into a PySpark DataFrame.
2. Rename a specific column in the DataFrame from gasyo to expense.
3. Print the schema of the DataFrame to display the data types.
4. Perform a summation of the `gasto` column grouped by `ciudad`.

#### Solution for Challenge 1:
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Expenses Challenge") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Step 1: Read the CSV file named expenses.csv
file_path = "expenses.csv"
df = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Step 2: Rename a column (e.g., rename 'gasto' to 'expense')
df = df.withColumnRenamed("gasto", "expense")

# Step 3: Print the schema of the DataFrame
df.printSchema()

# Step 4: Perform a summation by city
# Group by 'ciudad' and sum the 'expense' column
summation_df = df.groupBy("ciudad").agg(sum("expense").alias("total_expense"))

# Show the results
summation_df.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Refined Challenge 2
This challenge involves analyzing a table named `expenses` using SQL:
1. **Task 1:** Create a report to find rows with `NULL` values in the `sueldo` (salary) column.
2. **Task 2:** Add a label based on the `sueldo` (salary) column:
   - If `sueldo` < 10,000 USD, label them as `'Jr'`.
   - If `sueldo` >= 10,000 USD, label them as `'Senior'`.
3. **Task 3:** Find duplicate entries in the `expenses` table based on all columns.
4. **Task 4:** Compute aggregation metrics for the `sueldo` column, specifically the **SUM** and **MEAN** (average).

### SQL Solutions to Address the Refined Challenge

#### 1. Find Rows with `NULL` Values in the `sueldo` Column
```sql
SELECT *
FROM expenses
WHERE sueldo IS NULL;
```
**Output from the 10-row Sample:**
| ciudad        | user         | id    | gasto (expense) | sueldo (salary) |  
|---------------|--------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|  
| Los Angeles   | charlie      | 3     | 300             | NULL            |  
| Los Angeles   | charlie      | 3     | 300             | NULL            |  
| Miami         | bob          | 8     | 150             | NULL            |  

---

#### 2. Add a Label (`Seniority`) Based on the `sueldo` Column
```sql
SELECT 
    *, 
    CASE 
        WHEN sueldo < 10000 THEN 'Jr'
        WHEN sueldo >= 10000 THEN 'Senior'
    END AS Seniority
FROM expenses;
```
**Output from the 10-row Sample with `Seniority` Column:**
| ciudad        | user         | id    | gasto (expense) | sueldo (salary) | Seniority |  
|---------------|--------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|  
| New York      | alice        | 1     | 200             | 12000           | Senior    |  
| San Francisco | bob          | 2     | 150             | 8000            | Jr        |  
| Los Angeles   | charlie      | 3     | 300             | NULL            | NULL      |  
| New York      | david        | 4     | 400             | 15000           | Senior    |  
| San Francisco | alice        | 1     | 200             | 12000           | Senior    |  
| Miami         | emma         | 5     | 250             | 5000            | Jr        |  
| New York      | john         | 6     | 300             | 8000            | Jr        |  
| Los Angeles   | charlie      | 3     | 300             | NULL            | NULL      |  
| Seattle       | sarah        | 7     | 350             | 10000           | Senior    |  
| Miami         | bob          | 8     | 150             | NULL            | NULL      |  

---

#### 3. Find Duplicate Entries
```sql
SELECT 
    ciudad, user, id, gasto, sueldo, 
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM expenses
GROUP BY ciudad, user, id, gasto, sueldo
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
**Output from the 10-row Sample:**
| ciudad      | user     | id  | gasto | sueldo  | duplicate_count |  
|-------------|----------|-----|-------|---------|-----------------|  
| Los Angeles | charlie  | 3   | 300   | NULL    | 2               |  
| New York    | alice    | 1   | 200   | 12000   | 2               |  

---

#### 4. Aggregate Function: Compute SUM and MEAN of the `sueldo` Column
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(sueldo) AS total_salary, 
    AVG(sueldo) AS average_salary
FROM expenses;
```
**Output from the 10-row Sample (ignores `NULL` values):**
| total_salary | average_salary |  
|--------------|----------------|  
| 62000        | 10333.33       |  

---

### Explanation of Each Query:
1. **Finding nulls:** The query filters rows with `NULL` values in the `sueldo` column using the `IS NULL` condition.
2. **Adding Seniority labels:** Adds a column named `Seniority` with either the value `'Jr'` or `'Senior'`, depending on the value of the `sueldo` column.
3. **Finding duplicates:** Groups the table by all columns and counts occurrences, returning rows with `COUNT(*) > 1`.
4. **Aggregation (SUM and MEAN):** Calculates the total and average salary using `SUM()` and `AVG()` functions while ignoring `NULL` values in the `sueldo` column.

---

### Final Thoughts:
This refined challenge provides a variety of tasks, testing a candidate’s ability to clean, analyze, classify, and aggregate data with SQL. The provided sample data mirrors realistic data that could exist in an `expenses` table and helps simulate meaningful outputs for the queries.


Sure! Let me propose two small sample tables with 5 records each, and I will demonstrate the results of different types of SQL joins (**RIGHT JOIN**, **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **CROSS JOIN**) on these tables.

### Two Tables: `Employees` and `Departments`

#### Table 1: `Employees`
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |  
|------------|--------------|--------------|  
| 1          | Alice        | 101          |  
| 2          | Bob          | 102          |  
| 3          | Charlie      | NULL         |  
| 4          | David        | 103          |  
| 5          | Emma         | 104          |  

#### Table 2: `Departments`
| DepartmentID | DepartmentName  |  
|--------------|-----------------|  
| 101          | HR              |  
| 102          | IT              |  
| 103          | Finance         |  
| 105          | Sales           |  
| 106          | Marketing       |  

---

### Explanation of Joins

Now, let's perform the different types of joins (`RIGHT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`) on these tables and explain their results.

---

#### 1. **RIGHT JOIN**
The `RIGHT JOIN` returns **all rows from the right table (`Departments`)** and the matching rows from the left table (`Employees`). If there is no match, `NULL` is returned for non-matching columns from the left table.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d
ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

**Result:**
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |  
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|  
| 1          | Alice        | 101          | HR             |  
| 2          | Bob          | 102          | IT             |  
| 4          | David        | 103          | Finance         |  
| NULL       | NULL         | 105          | Sales          |  
| NULL       | NULL         | 106          | Marketing      |  

---

#### 2. **INNER JOIN**
The `INNER JOIN` returns **only the rows with matching values in both tables** (based on the `ON` condition).

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d
ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

**Result:**
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |  
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|  
| 1          | Alice        | 101          | HR             |  
| 2          | Bob          | 102          | IT             |  
| 4          | David        | 103          | Finance        |  

---

#### 3. **LEFT JOIN**
The `LEFT JOIN` returns **all rows from the left table (`Employees`)** and the matching rows from the right table (`Departments`). If there is no match, `NULL` is returned for non-matching columns from the right table.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d
ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

**Result:**
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |  
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|  
| 1          | Alice        | 101          | HR             |  
| 2          | Bob          | 102          | IT             |  
| 3          | Charlie      | NULL         | NULL           |  
| 4          | David        | 103          | Finance        |  
| 5          | Emma         | 104          | NULL           |  

---

#### 4. **CROSS JOIN**
The `CROSS JOIN` returns **the Cartesian product of both tables**. In other words, every row in the first table is combined with every row in the second table.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
CROSS JOIN Departments d;
```

**Result:**
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |  
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|  
| 1          | Alice        | 101          | HR             |  
| 1          | Alice        | 102          | IT             |  
| 1          | Alice        | 103          | Finance        |  
| 1          | Alice        | 105          | Sales          |  
| 1          | Alice        | 106          | Marketing      |  
| 2          | Bob          | 101          | HR             |  
| 2          | Bob          | 102          | IT             |  
| 2          | Bob          | 103          | Finance        |  
| 2          | Bob          | 105          | Sales          |  
| 2          | Bob          | 106          | Marketing      |  
| 3          | Charlie      | 101          | HR             |  
| ... (15 more rows omitted for brevity) |

---

### Key Takeaways for Each Join Type:
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Ensures that all rows from the right table are included, even if they do not have a match in the left table.
- **INNER JOIN:** Includes only rows from both tables where there is a match (intersection of the two tables).
- **LEFT JOIN:** Ensures that all rows from the left table are included, even if they do not have a match in the right table.
- **CROSS JOIN:** Produces a Cartesian product, leading to `m × n` rows where `m` is the number of rows in the left table and `n` is the number of rows in the right table.
