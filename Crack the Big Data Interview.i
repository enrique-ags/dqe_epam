Cracking the Persistent L1 Interview â€“ Key Questions & Answers! ðŸš€
Today, I had the opportunity to attend a Persistent L1 interview, where I faced some interesting Big Data & Spark questions. Hereâ€™s a quick recap of the topics covered:
ðŸ”¹ Joins in Spark â€“ Explained different types like Inner, Left, Right, Full Outer, Cross, and Broadcast joins.
 ðŸ”¹ Bucketing vs Partitioning â€“ Partitioning divides data into separate folders, while Bucketing distributes data into fixed-size buckets for optimized joins.
 ðŸ”¹ EC2 vs EMR â€“ EC2 provides virtual servers, whereas EMR is a managed Hadoop/Spark cluster for big data processing.
 ðŸ”¹ Spark Architecture â€“ Covered DAG, Executors, Tasks, and how Spark distributes workloads.
 ðŸ”¹ Rank vs DenseRank â€“ Rank skips values for duplicates, while DenseRank gives consecutive ranking.
 ðŸ”¹ Optimization Techniques â€“ Discussed Predicate Pushdown, Partition Pruning, Caching, and Broadcast Joins.
 ðŸ”¹ DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) â€“ Explained how Spark transforms logical execution plans into optimized physical plans.
ðŸ’¡ SQL Challenges:
 âœ… Find products with the same name but different prices:
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE productname IN (
 SELECT productname FROM products 
 GROUP BY productname 
 HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT price) > 1
);
âœ… Find products where sales increased continuously for 3 years in the last 20 years:
SELECT product, year, sales FROM (
 SELECT *, 
 LEAD(sales, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY year) AS next_1_year,
 LEAD(sales, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY year) AS next_2_year
 FROM sales
) t 
WHERE sales < next_1_year AND next_1_year < next_2_year
ORDER BY product, year;
I found this interview both challenging and insightful! If you're preparing for Big Data interviews, these questions can help.
