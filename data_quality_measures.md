Data quality is a critical factor in the success of data-driven decision making, and maintaining high-quality data across systems involves adhering to several key dimensions. There are seven commonly recognized dimensions of data quality that you should consider:

### 1. Accuracy
- **Definition:** The extent to which data correctly describes the real-world object or event it is supposed to depict. This involves ensuring the data is correct and free from error.
- **Measure:** Comparing data against pre-defined standards or known sources of truth, such as verifying addresses against postal records.

### 2. Completeness
- **Definition:** Refers to the extent that all required data is available.
- **Measure:** Checking for missing values or data records. For instance, ensuring every user entry in a database has a corresponding email and phone number.

### 3. Consistency
- **Definition:** Ensures that the data across different databases or at different points in time remain the same or logically compatible.
- **Measure:** Cross-referencing or reconciling data across systems to identify discrepancies. For example, ensuring an account balance matches across reporting and transaction databases.

### 4. Reliability
- **Definition:** Refers to the extent to which data can be depended upon to faithfully represent the information it was intended to convey, often under different conditions.
- **Measure:** Testing the data under different conditions to ensure it remains accurate and consistent.

### 5. Timeliness
- **Definition:** Involves whether the data is up-to-date and available within a useful time frame. Time-sensitive data loses value if not processed in a timely manner.
- **Measure:** Checking the lag time from data capture to data availability and use. For example, ensuring financial transactions are recorded and available in reports by the next business day.

### 6. Validity
- **Definition:** Data that conforms to the defined business rules and constraints of its specific domain or use case.
- **Measure:** Enforcement through data input validation rules, such as format checks (e.g., date fields containing dates, postal codes conforming to valid formats) and range checks (e.g., age entries that must fall within a human lifespan).

### 7. Uniqueness
- **Definition:** Ensuring that data entries are not duplicated in the dataset.
- **Measure:** Identifying and removing or consolidating duplicates within datasets. For example, no two customers should share the same unique customer identification number in a CRM system.

These seven dimensions offer a comprehensive framework for assessing and improving data quality across diverse datasets and systems. Efforts to enhance data quality should ideally address all relevant dimensions to ensure that data is functional and valuable for its intended use. Tools, services, and data governance policies are often employed to monitor and maintain data quality in light of these dimensions.
